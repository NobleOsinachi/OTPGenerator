README for OTPGenerator Repo

Introduction
------------

OTPGenerator is a simple TypeScript code that generates a 6-digit One Time Password (OTP) using a mathematical algorithm. This OTP can be used as an additional layer of security for various online accounts and services that require two-factor authentication.

Usage
-----

To generate a 6-digit OTP, you can use the `generateOTP()` function provided in the `otp-generator.ts` file. This function takes in no arguments and returns a 6-digit OTP as a string.
